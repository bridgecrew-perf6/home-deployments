# home-deployments

Docker compose files for various stacks. Compose files use environment variables which need to be setup on the system beforehand. I personally use [Portainer CE](https://docs.portainer.io/v/ce-2.11/start/install?_ga=2.131695053.330745444.1653687369-142713316.1653687369) to deploy the stacks.
